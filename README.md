# Idle Battle Server

chrome-extension://pfdhoblngboilpfeibdedpjgfnlcodoo/index.html

## TODO
* Before the match starts, make a few echos to the server to calculate the average latency.
It can be used to move forward the units when receiving the launch action
* Create collections to handle more efficiently the matches, players, lanes, etc (class Matches, Players, Lanes, etc)
* Create ready dialog with players names while ready countdown is active
* Countdown yellow when 30 seconds left
